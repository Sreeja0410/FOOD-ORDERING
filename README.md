# FOOD-ORDERING WEB APPLICATION- FOOD MART
**PROBLEM STATEMENT**:

To address the persistent issue of long queues at Barista and canteens, particularly for freshly prepared food items, we have devised a solution in the form of a website. This platform allows the residents of our institute to order food from the comfort of their rooms or classrooms, eliminating the need to navigate through crowded dining areas.

With our website, users can conveniently pre-order their food and pay for it online. Each order is assigned a unique token, and the estimated preparation time is also provided. Users simply need to collect their food at the designated time by presenting the issued token, which ensures a hassle-free and efficient process.



**SOLUTION**:

This website will provide students with a platform for food-ordering purposes. The main advantages of this website are reducing fraud cases and users knowing the estimated time for item preparation might reduce the wastage of time standing in queues. The website's interface will be user-friendly, ensuring that all students can use it without any difficulty.

User Authentication: The website will feature a user authentication system that requires them to log in using their email ID and password.

Product Filtering functionality: The website will have search functionality that enables students to filter food items available at each store according to their preferences.

User Feedback:  The website will allow users to give feedback on the food items they have ordered, including their quality, quantity, and delivery time.

Estimated time for food preparation/delivery: Estimated time is shown when the order is placed based on an algorithm.
Popular food items display: Popular items are displayed.

Payment redirecting to UPI app: Payment gateway integration using JusPay.

Providing a token number for each order: A token is generated for the user after the payment is successful which can be used at the stall for collecting the order.

Add to cart functionality: Basic Add to cart feature.

Creating both owner-side and user-side working models: In the case of the user side we provide all the above-stated features whereas, on the owner side, we provide the orders received, transaction details, etc.
